# Tutorials
Code written in my advanced computation physics classes in Python
The goal of this repository is to show methods I used for solving various problems during my dual Bachelors and Masters in Physics
Others should feel welcome to test them out, apply them to their own problems, and suggest other methods or improvements to the code
